![Jacob Shkrob Profile](/assets/profile.jpg)

 Hello/Bonjour/Привет! I am a first year PhD student at [NYU Courant](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/) studying mainly probability, stochastic analysis, partial differential equations, and applications to biology and machine learning. I did my undergraduate degree in Probability and Statistics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) under the supervision of [Jessica Lin](https://sites.google.com/view/jessicalin-math/home) studying Random Walk in Random Environment and connections to stochastic homogenization.
