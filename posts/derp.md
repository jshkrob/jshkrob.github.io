# Title: First post

Here are two nice facts on spectra of random matrices of large size $n$. 
- When $A$ is a Girko matrix, the eigenvalues of $A/\sqrt{n}$ asymptotically follow the [circular law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_law) -- they tend to be uniformly distributed in $\mathbb{D} = D(0,1)$. By **Girko matrix**, I mean a matrix where all the entries are iid real[^1] random variables, centered, with variance 1. 
- When $A$ is a Wigner matrix, the eigenvalues of $A/\sqrt{n}$ asymptotically follow a [semi-circle law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_semicircle_distribution), and in particular they are real. By **Wigner matrix**, I mean a symmetric matrix where all the entries on and above the diagonal are iid real random variables, centered, with variance 1.
